# File Handling in Python

---

File handling is an essential skill in programming, allowing you to create, read, update, and delete files in your filesystem. Python provides several built-in functions and modules to facilitate file operations, including working with text files, CSV files, and JSON files. Additionally, Python's exception handling capabilities ensure that your file operations are robust and error-free.

### 1. **Opening a File**

To work with a file, you first need to open it using Python's `open()` function. This function returns a file object, which you can use to interact with the file. The `open()` function takes two primary arguments: the file name and the mode in which you want to open the file.

**File Modes:**

- `'r'`: Read mode (default) – Opens the file for reading.
- `'w'`: Write mode – Opens the file for writing (creates a new file if it doesn't exist or truncates the file if it does).
- `'a'`: Append mode – Opens the file for appending (creates a new file if it doesn't exist).
- `'b'`: Binary mode – Used for binary files (e.g., images, videos).
- `'t'`: Text mode (default) – Used for text files.
- `'x'`: Exclusive creation – Creates a new file and returns an error if the file already exists.

**Example:**

```python
# Open a file for reading (default mode)
file = open("example.txt", "r")

# Open a file for writing
file = open("example.txt", "w")

# Open a file for appending
file = open("example.txt", "a")
```

### 2. **Reading from Files**

After opening a file in read mode, you can read its contents using various methods:

- `read()`: Reads the entire content of the file.
- `readline()`: Reads one line from the file.
- `readlines()`: Reads all lines and returns them as a list.

**Examples:**

```python
# Reading the entire file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

# Reading the first line of the file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    line = file.readline()
    print(line)

# Reading all lines into a list
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    print(lines)

# Reading specific number of characters
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read(10)  # Read the first 10 characters
    print(content)
```

### 3. **Writing to Files**

When writing to a file, you can use the `write()` or `writelines()` methods. Writing to a file can either overwrite the existing content (using `'w'` mode) or append to it (using `'a'` mode).

**Examples:**

```python
# Writing to a file (overwrites existing content)
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("This is a new line.\\n")
    file.write("This will overwrite the previous content.\\n")

# Appending to a file
with open("example.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("This line will be appended to the file.\\n")

# Writing multiple lines
lines = ["First line\\n", "Second line\\n", "Third line\\n"]
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.writelines(lines)
```

### 4. **Working with Different File Types (Text, CSV, JSON)**

Python provides built-in support for working with various file types, such as text files, CSV files, and JSON files. Each file type has specific methods and modules for reading and writing operations.

### **Text Files**

Text files contain plain text and can be read or written using the standard file handling methods in Python.

**Example:**

```python
# Reading a text file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

# Writing to a text file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("This is a text file.\\n")
```

### **CSV Files**

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are commonly used for storing tabular data. Python's `csv` module provides functionality to read from and write to CSV files.

**Example:**

```python
import csv

# Writing to a CSV file
with open("data.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["Name", "Age", "City"])
    writer.writerow(["Alice", 30, "New York"])
    writer.writerow(["Bob", 25, "Los Angeles"])

# Reading from a CSV file
with open("data.csv", "r") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

**Output:**

```
['Name', 'Age', 'City']
['Alice', 30, 'New York']
['Bob', 25, 'Los Angeles']
```

### **JSON Files**

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format. Python's `json` module allows you to work with JSON data by converting Python objects to JSON and vice versa.

**Example:**

```python
import json

# Writing to a JSON file
data = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

with open("data.json", "w") as file:
    json.dump(data, file, indent=4)

# Reading from a JSON file
with open("data.json", "r") as file:
    data = json.load(file)
    print(data)
```

**Output:**

```json
{
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}
```

### 5. **Exception Handling in File Operations**

File operations can sometimes result in errors, such as trying to read a file that doesn't exist. Python provides robust exception handling to manage these errors and prevent your program from crashing.

### **Handling Exceptions with Try-Except**

Use the `try-except` block to catch and handle exceptions during file operations.

**Example:**

```python
try:
    with open("nonexistent_file.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: The file does not exist.")
except IOError:
    print("Error: An I/O error occurred.")
```

**Output:**

```
Error: The file does not exist.
```

### **Using Finally for Cleanup**

The `finally` block is used to execute code that should run regardless of whether an exception occurs. This is particularly useful for closing files or releasing resources.

**Example:**

```python
try:
    file = open("example.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    file.close()  # Ensures that the file is always closed
```

### **Using `with` Statement**

The `with` statement automatically handles closing the file, even if an exception is raised, making it the preferred way to handle files in Python.

**Example:**

```python
try:
    with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
        print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: The file does not exist.")
```
