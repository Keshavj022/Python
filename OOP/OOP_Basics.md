# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

## Key Concepts of OOP:
1. **Classes and Objects**: The building blocks of OOP. A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
2. **Attributes and Methods**: Attributes are the properties of an object, and methods are the functions associated with an object.
3. **Encapsulation**: Bundling the data (attributes) and the code (methods) that manipulates the data into a single unit or class.
4. **Inheritance**: A way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined.
5. **Polymorphism**: The ability to define a method in different ways in different classes.
6. **Abstraction**: Hiding the internal implementation of a function, exposing only the necessary parts.

### Why Use OOP?

- **Modularity**: Breaking down problems into smaller, manageable pieces.
- **Code Reusability**: Using existing code for new problems.
- **Flexibility**: Easier to manage changes and updates to the codebase.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces complexity by modeling real-world entities.
